## ⚠️ **CRITICAL: READ THESE FIRST!** ⚠️

Before diving into features and technical specs, review these critical planning documents that cover **85+ areas** to prevent project failure:

### 🔍 **1. GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - What Could Go Wrong
**📖 60-90 minutes** | **🎯 10 Critical Failure Points & Solutions**

**Covers:**
- Infrastructure & DevOps (what breaks at scale)
- Scalability & Performance (1K → 1M users)
- User Experience & Onboarding (preventing bounce)
- Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Customer Support Strategy
- Data Privacy & Security (GDPR, CCPA)
- Analytics & Data Strategy
- Product Roadmap & Prioritization
- Financial Planning & Revenue Model
- Launch & Growth Strategy

**Read this to avoid the top 10 reasons projects fail**

---

### ✅ **2. PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md** - Are You Ready to Build?
**📖 40-60 minutes** | **🎯 9-Phase Comprehensive Checklist**

**100+ Checkpoints Across:**
- Business & Vision
- Legal & Compliance
- Financial Planning
- Technical Architecture
- Security & Performance
- UX Planning
- Analytics Setup
- Quality Assurance
- DevOps & Deployment

**Plus:** Red Flags vs. Green Lights | 80/20 Rule (Essential 20%)

**Read this to know EXACTLY what needs to be in place before coding**

---

**🚨 Why These Matter:**

**Projects fail from:**
- ❌ Running out of money (no financial planning)
- ❌ Can't scale (no architecture for growth)
- ❌ Legal issues (no compliance planning)
- ❌ Security breaches (no security design)
- ❌ Nobody uses it (no launch strategy)

**These documents prevent ALL of those failures.**
